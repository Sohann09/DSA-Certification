# Decode C++ with DSA Certification
I am happy to share that I have successfully completed the Decode C++ with DSA Certification! This journey has been an incredible learning experience, and I am proud to have solved around 170 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems during this course.

Got it! Here's the revised version of your `README.md` without mentioning greedy algorithms or dynamic programming (DP):

## ðŸš€ Skills Acquired and Enhanced

Through this certification, I have significantly improved my programming and problem-solving skills. Hereâ€™s how this journey has shaped me:

1. **Strong Foundation in DSA**:
   - Gained a deep understanding of core data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
   - Mastered essential algorithms including sorting, searching and graph traversals (BFS, DFS).

2. **Improved Problem-Solving Intuition**:
   - Developed a strong intuition for breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
   - Learned to identify patterns and apply the right data structures and algorithms to solve problems efficiently.

3. **C++ Proficiency**:
   - Enhanced my C++ programming skills, including object-oriented programming (OOP), STL (Standard Template Library), and efficient memory management.
   - Gained hands-on experience in writing clean, optimized, and reusable code.

4. **Optimization and Time Complexity**:
   - Learned to analyze time and space complexity (Big-O notation) to write efficient code.
   - Improved my ability to optimize solutions for better performance.

5. **Consistency and Hard Work**:
   - Solved **170+ DSA problems** across various difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard).
   - Built a habit of consistent practice, which has been key to my growth.

6. **Confidence in Coding Interviews**:
   - Gained the confidence to tackle coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.
   - Improved my ability to think critically and approach problems methodically.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Solving a wide variety of problems has helped me understand the nuances of DSA and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recognizing common problem patterns has made it easier to devise efficient solutions.
- **Never Give Up**: Some problems were challenging, but persistence and a growth mindset helped me overcome them.
